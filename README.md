# The Lost Adventurer
	    You live in the land of Ascana as a lonely adventurer
  You try and make riches but have struggled to make a good living, although there may be a new 
  chance for you. You have heard tales about a treasure from many different
  people and creatures, all have dreamed to one day find the treasure but no one 
  has ever found it. Those who have seen it have never made it out alive to tell the 
  story. There are many different ideas on what this fabled treasure could be. 
  Some say itâ€™s untold amounts of gold, some say it holds your wildest dreams,
  others say that it gives you the most powerful magic in the land. You have come 
  to the mystical forest of Ascana in search of this hidden treasure. Only you will 
  be able to learn what the treasure truly is, you shall venture into the forest, 
  survive the dangers of the forest and find the treasure. There are different
  dangers you have been told of, the greed of the goblins, the undead hunger of 
  the zombies, the frail but strong will of the skeletons, and even guardians that 
  have been rumoured to guard the treasure. You will have to bargain with the 
  villagers and people of this land, you will survive with the creatures that live in
  the forest to get to your goal. Will you be brave enough to venture deep into the 
  dark caves of this forest, will you be brave enough to face these rumoured 
  guardians, will you be brave enough to overcome the hunger you feel throughout 
  your journey and finish your quest? Only you will know this when you venture 
  out on your quest for gold, riches, and power, and finally achieve your dreams 
  of finding the mystical lost treasure of Arcana.
